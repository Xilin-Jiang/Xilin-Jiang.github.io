Our research program has uniquely combines translational medicine (Cambridge) and strong statistical genetics expertise (Harvard). We are blessed with access to some of the most unique data sets (60 million EHR samples in [CVD-COVID-UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/projects/cvd-covid-uk-project/), [INTERVAL](https://www.intervalstudy.org.uk), etc.) Opportunities to work on these projects are always available and I am generally happy to discuss the suitability to work with us or jointly with one of our collaborators.

We are looking for talented postdoctoral fellows/software engineer to join our collaborative porject. If you are a recent PhD graduates and are interested in our projects, please get in touch by sending your cv to me. This position has a primary affiliation at Cambridge University. <!-- We could guarantee a global talent visa for international scholars and argue for a reasonable increase of the salary, depending on the experiences.--> You will benifit from multi-dimensional mentoring from senior faculties from both Cambridge University and Harvard University, inluding Professor Michael Inouye (mult-omics), Professor John Danesh (health outcomes), Professor Alkes Price (statistical geneitics).  

If you are interested in working on a related project through a primary affiliation at Harvard University, you will need to get in touch with Professor Alkes Price. Strong candidate may get in touch with me for a potential reference to Professor Alkes Price.   

Perspective PhD students need to get in one of the 4-year doctoral training program at Cambridge University before getting in touch (example programs include [BHF](https://www.cardiovascular.cam.ac.uk/students/prospective/phd-bhfcardio), [Biostatistics](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/cvbupdbst), and [Sanger](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/study/phd-programmes/4-year-phd-programme/)). To work with us through Harvard University, you need to be accepted by one of the strong quantitative PhD programs (either Harvard or MIT, through Broad Institute) and work on a rotation project at Professor Alkes Price's group. In this case, you may get in touch to discuss a potential co-supervised rotation project.
