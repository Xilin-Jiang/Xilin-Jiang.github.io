I am a statistical geneticist working on using molecular data to explain health outcomes. I am particularly interested in how additional data modality could enhance our current understanding of diseases.


I am broadly interested in two themes of research:
<ul>
   <li>Methodology development: I am interested in developing statistical methods to understand the molecular architecture (DNA, RNA, proteomics, metabolomics) of health outcomes (disease, treatment responses, comorbidity). In statistical terminology, I work on dimension reduction, longitudinal analysis, efficient inference methods, and causal inference.</li>
   <li>Translational research: We are collaborating with the NHS to develop tools and resources for computing risk scores using polygenic models, protein/metabolite levels, and e-health records. We work closely with clinical teams to investigate potential applications including clinical trials, treatment response prediction, and risk stratification. </li>
</ul>

If you are interested in working with [us](/People/), check the [opportunities page](/opportunities/)! Currently there are  PhD positions at Cambridge  <!--[DPT-MR](https://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/study/doctoral-training-programme-medical-research-dtp-mr) (fully-funded) or --> [PhD in Public Health](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/cvphpdhpc) (need to find external funding). <!-- If you are interesting in working with me through the DPT-MR program, you should apply to the program directly and choose to do a rotation with us (--- choosing project and group is a really important decision and the best way to make informed decision is trying it out--). I am not involved in the admission of this program so there is no benifit of getting in touch before enrolling in the program. -->     

My research is funded by a Wellcome Early-Career award. I have a primary affiliation at Cambridge University and a secondary affiliation at Harvard School of Public Health. I have close collaboration with Professor [Alkes Price](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/) at Harvard School of Pulic health, Professor [Mike Inouye](https://www.inouyelab.org/home/people), and Professor [John Danesh](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/professor-john-danesh/) at University of Cambridge. Previously I held a one-year transition British Heart Foundation career development fellowship (2022-2023). I got my DPhil in Genomic Medicine and Statistics from Oxford University, funded by a [Rhodes Scholarship](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholars-alumni/rhodes-scholar-database/) and a [Wellcome Trust studentship](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-genomic-medicine-and-statistics). I received a BSc from Fudan University with an overall top GPA. I have experience in other computational biology topics, including infectious diseases (as a consultant to the Gates Foundation and China CDC on COVID response) and computational neuroscience (as an undergraduate researcher with Professor [Thomas Yeo](https://sites.google.com/view/yeolab/thomas) and Professor [David Heeger](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/)).

During my PhD study, I enjoyed Oxford life through many (perhaps too many) events. I delivered the [scholar address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zVKDZMq66A&t=536s) (name for a student speech delivered at the scholarship graduating ceremony) for the Rhodes scholar class of 2017; I organised two [Rhodes China Trips]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/Small_FinalreportRhodesChinaTrip20190501.pdf); I kept supporting Rhodes Scholarship for China through multiple types of (volunteering) services. 

I raced middle distance for my undergraduate college and tried triathlons at Oxford. I occasionally [race local runs from 5k up to marathon](https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=1211646) to maintain fitness. Besides all this, I am an avid cook and was an apprentice under a chef specialised in Huai-Yang (<span lang="zh">淮扬菜</span>) cuisine.

For English speakers, my name is pronounced Xi-lin (SHYEE-lin; <span lang="zh">熹霖</span>) Jiang (JYAHNG; <span lang="zh">江</span>); “Xi” is a common pronunciation in Mandarin, and my name <span lang="zh">熹</span> is one of the 437 distinct Chinese characters that share this pronunciation.
