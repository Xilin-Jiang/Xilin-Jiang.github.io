I am a statistical geneticist working on using molecular data to explain health outcomes. I am particular interested in how additional data modality could enhance our current understanding of disease. 

I am working as a British Heart Foundation fellow with with Professor Mike Inouye and Professor John Danesh at Cambridge University, with a secondary appointment at Harvard School of Public Helath with Professor Alkes Price. I got my DPhil in Genomic Medicine and Statistics from Oxford University, funded by a Rhodes Scholarship and a Wellcome Trust studentship. I delivered the scholar address (name for a student speech delivered at the scholarship graduating ceremony) for the Rhodes scholar class of 2017. At the beginning of Pandemic, I worked as a consultant to the Gates Foundation and China CDC. Before my DPhil I worked on neural imaging modelling, analysing both structure and functional MRI data. I received my BSc from Fudan University.

 Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
