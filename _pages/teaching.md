Our research program has a unique combination of translational medicine (Cambridge) and strong statistical genetics expertise (Harvard). We are blessed with access to some of the most unique data sets (60 million EHR samples in [CVD-COVID-UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/projects/cvd-covid-uk-project/), [INTERVAL](https://www.intervalstudy.org.uk), etc.) Opportunities to work on these projects are always available and I am generally happy to discuss the suitability to work with us or jointly with one of our collaborators.


We are looking for talented postdoctoral fellows/software engineer to join us. If you are a recent PhD graduates and are interested in our projects, please get in touch by sending your cv to me. This position has a primary affiliation at Cambridge University. We could guarantee a global talent visa for international scholars and argue for a reasonable increase of the salary, depending on the experiences. 


If you are interested in working on a related project through a primary affiliation at Harvard University, you will need to get in touch with Professor Alkes Price. Strong candidate might get in touch with me for a potential reference to Professor Alkes Price.   


Perspective PhD students need to get in one of the 4-year doctoral training program at Cambridge University before getting in touch (example programs including [BHF](https://www.cardiovascular.cam.ac.uk/students/prospective/phd-bhfcardio), [Biostatistics](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/cvbupdbst), and [Sanger](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/study/phd-programmes/4-year-phd-programme/)). To work with us through Harvard University, you need to be accepted by one of the strong quantitative PhD projects and work through a rotation project at Professor Alkes Price's group. In this case, you could get in touch to discuss a potential co-supervised rotation project.
